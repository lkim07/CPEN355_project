2,"The Bank of Canada's measures of core inflation, CPI-common, CPI-median and CPI-trim, are subject to revision. In the case of CPI-median and CPI-trim, the revisions result from the fact that these measures are based on seasonally adjusted price index series. In the case of CPI-common, revisions are due to the statistical technique used, as the factor model is estimated over all available historical data. Table 18-10-0259-01 contains historical data for these three measures and is updated on a monthly basis."
3,"This measure is based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) series adjusted to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes."
4,"This measure is based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) series that have been treated to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes, and that have been seasonally adjusted."
5,"CPI-common is a measure of core inflation that tracks common price changes across categories in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket."
6,"CPI-median is a measure of core inflation corresponding to the price change located at the 50th percentile (in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket weights) of the distribution of price changes in a given month."
7,"CPI-trim is a measure of core inflation that excludes Consumer Price Index (CPI) components whose rates of change in a given month are located in the tails of the distribution of price changes."
8,"Eight of the most volatile components identified by the Bank of Canada include: fruit, fruit preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage interest cost; natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and smokers' supplies."
9,"Differences in historical data exist between this table and table 176-0003. These differences are attributable to the use of Statistics Canada's full-precision input series and unique seasonal adjustment specifications, which were not previously available for the calculations made by the Bank of Canada."
10,"From April 2020 to November 2021, and from January 2022 to February 2022, certain sub-indexes and components thereof were imputed using special approaches in either one, or more months. The affected indexes include child care services; housekeeping services; air transportation; personal care services; recreational services; travel tours; spectator entertainment; use of recreational facilities and services; beer served in licensed establishments; wine served in licensed establishments, and liquor served in licensed establishments. The details of these treatments from April 2020 to March 2021 are provided in technical supplements available through the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/62F0014M" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prices Analytical Series(opens new window)</a>. Starting in April 2021, details and treatments are available upon request by contacting the <a href="mailto:statcan.cpddisseminationunit-dpcunitedediffusion.statcan@statcan.gc.ca" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consumer Prices Division (opens new window)</a>."
11,"As of the January 2024 reference month, the CPI-trim and CPI-median year-over-year change indicators are calculated based on index values rounded to one decimal place. Previously, the year-over-year change indicators of these two measures of core inflation were calculated based on full precision (unrounded) index values. To eliminate incoherence, the year-over-year change figures for CPI-trim and CPI-median are now calculated based on index values rounded to one decimal place. As a result of this change, the historical year-over-year change figures for CPI-trim and CPI-median have been revised back to January 1990."
